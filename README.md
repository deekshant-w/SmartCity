HackMSIT hackathon submission for team noobs

This project was my first attempt in a hackathon, it's a sort of unified complainting system under which the complaints of the whole city, disregarding who is it concerned to is submitted under a single app and is then delivered to whom so ever concerned.

Although this is a very rudimentary approach, and the software still requres a great amount of work to be done on it, yet it is just a concept waiting to spread it's roots into reality.
